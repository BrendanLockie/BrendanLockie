		<p> <h1>My first scratch game is called "Bust Down D-Money"</h1></p>
		<p> <h1>D-Money jumps on a trampoline on the moon like a game of pong. Try to keep D-Money on the trampoline and out of the lava.</h1></p>
		<p> <h1>We used block coding as a part of the program scratch to make the game. We initially had two sprites, D-Money and the trampoline. We later added two more sprites, the stars, which add extra points when D-Money touches them.</h1></p>
		<p> <h1>Lastly, we added music to our game to make it more fun.</h1></p>

<p><h1>My second game was made with MIT app inventor. My group made a GPA grade calculator that calculates an individual's GPA for one semester.</h1>  </p>
	<p> <h1>We also included A.P. classes as an option to more accurately calculate one's GPA.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>My group used "list pickers" to organize the classes into groupings as well as to separate AP and honors classes from nomral classes.</h1></p>		  
<p> <h1>Below I have shown a couple of images showing what the app looks like on a tablet as well as what the code looks like for the app.</h1></p>

<p> <h1>My third game is called "Sinking Ship." It is a part of the interactive fiction lesson.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>My partner, Aniket, and I made our interactive fiction story using Canopy. The plot of our story was associated with the "Quest" format.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>We wrote "print" and then text for the program to repeat to the player after the player inserts a response to a question. We also used various if, then, elif statements to ask questions and create a pathway for the player to navigate through.</h1></p>

<p> <h1>My fourth project is a simulation. The simulation originally shot fireworks in a typical fashion.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>My group used a website called netlogo to edit the code. </h1></p>
<p> <h1>We made it so the velocity of the fireworks move much slower after the initial particle explodes.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>We divided the velocity in both the x and y axis by one thousand thus decreasing its speed.</h1></p>	
<p> <h1>Now the fireworks move much slower after exploding and most of the particles move downward almost immediately.</h1></p>

<p> <h1>Below are images from my next project. I made GUI changes using Tkinter.</h1></p>	
<p> <h1>I was able to use repl.it/languages/tkinter</h1></p>
<p> <h1>This way I was able to use tkinter in my browser since I wasn't able to download any programs onto my computer.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>The program I created first states "I hope you are doing well". Then it tells you to click the button.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>Once you click the button, the program says "Woo! You clicked the buton! Nice job"</h1></p>
<p> <h1>I was able to use Tkinter to create this graphic user interface or GUI.</h1></p>

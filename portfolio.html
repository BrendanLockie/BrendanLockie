		<p> <h1>My first scratch game is called "Bust Down D-Money"</h1></p>
		<p> <h1>D-Money jumps on a trampoline on the moon like a game of pong. Try to keep D-Money on the trampoline and out of the lava.</h1></p>
		<p> <h1>We used block coding as a part of the program scratch to make the game. We initially had two sprites, D-Money and the trampoline. We later added two more sprites, the stars, which add extra points when D-Money touches them.</h1></p>
		<p> <h1>Lastly, we added music to our game to make it more fun.</h1></p>

<p><h1>My second game was made with MIT app inventor. My group made a GPA grade calculator that calculates an individual's GPA for one semester.</h1>  </p>
	<p> <h1>We also included A.P. classes as an option to more accurately calculate one's GPA.</h1></p>
<p> <h1>My group used "list pickers" to organize the classes into groupings as well as to separate AP and honors classes from nomral classes.</h1></p>		  
<p> <h1>Below I have shown a couple of images showing what the app looks like on a tablet as well as what the code looks like for the app.</h1></p>
